This Repository holds the [Beansjam'22](https://itch.io/jam/beansjam-22) entry "[Driving Nightmare](https://misterixi.itch.io/driving-nightmare)". Since the jam is in german most of the text in and around the game is also in german.

The theme was "Wir m√ºssen wach bleiben" which translates to "we have to stay awake".

## Don't sleep and drive!

# Contributions
The specifics are listed in-game, but the three contributers listed here were on the team in the 48 hours: ChocolandTV, Kzzss and MisterIXI

All assets were created by us in Blender, Audacity and Unity except for the car crash sound taken from [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/people/magnuswaker/sounds/592388/)


# Controls

Car: WASD (A/D for steering and W/S for accelerating and braking)
Drink Energy can: SPACEBAR

# Mechanics
Although structured like an endless runner there is a defined end after X *distance* you travelled. The slower you travel the longer it takes to reach the finish.  
  
Top right is your sleepiness. Once it reaches the right side your eyes close and you can't control the car for a second. After sleeping it partially recovers.
Drinking an energydrink tops up your sleepyness and also wakes you up.  
The darkness slowly creeps towards you according to your sleepiness but after a certain point your vision starts to dim as a whole.
  
The road winds through a dense forest and while smaller objects like rocks and grass don't impact you, your car breaks down if crash with a bigger obstacle.
